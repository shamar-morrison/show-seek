### Feature Request

---

I want to make some UI changes to the sign in and sign up screens.

### Changes needed

---

# Both Screens:

- Add appropriate icons inside the input field, e.g., a mail icon for email and lock icon for password
- Reduce the size of the title and subtitle (Welcome Back/Sign in to continue and Create Account/Sign up to get started) and center them horizontally.
- Add the app name and logo at the top, the logo should be clipped inside a circle to make it look fully rounded.

# Sign In Screen:

- Reduce the gap between the sign in and continue as guest button
