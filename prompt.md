### Feature request

I want to make “reminders” a premium feature.

### Changes Needed

- If the user clicks the “reminder” button on the tv detail screen and they are not a premium member, show them the dialog about needing to upgrade to premium so they can either choose to go to the upgrade screen or cancel and stay on the Current screen
- Add the premium badge to the “reminders” button on the library screen and if the user taps it take them straight to the upgrade screen

Do you have any questions ?
