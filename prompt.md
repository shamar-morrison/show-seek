### Feature Request

---

I want to move the icons in the top right header on the custom list id screen into a truesheet modal.

### How it should work

---

The custom list id screen currently has rename, delete and sort icons in the header and I expect to add more so I want to add a single icon instead which will trigger a truesheet modal that has all the actions inside. Each action should maintain their existing functionality and also include a label beside the icon.

### Implementations details

---

The truesheet should have automatic height and detents so it can size itself based on the items inside it.

If you have any questions you can ask before starting.

1. A settings icon, we are using a standard settings icon in the app right now I believe like the one on the home screen
2. large tappable rows similar to iOS
3. a reusable component
