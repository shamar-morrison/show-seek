### Bug Description

There is bug in the reminders flow. Once the reminder has fired the card says “released” which doesn’t make sense unless the user opted into only getting reminded for a season premiere and it was released and there is no other season premiere date to show. But if the user is suppose to get reminded for every episode then the card should update itself to show the next episode when the current one has aired. the design of the card may need to change which is fine. Do you understand and do you have any questions?

1. scan the codebase and find it
2. indicate that on the card with like a "no new episode found" status or something similar
3. users can manually dismiss them
4. check the code
