### Overview

I want to implement a toggle between a section list view and the regular grid view for favorite people screen. similar to the toggle in episode ratings.

### Section List View

This view should use a section list using headers from the "known_for_department" of the people in the list. The layout of the person card for this view should be similar to the ones in the episode ratings screen where each card has the person image, their name and their job.

### Grid View (3 column layout)

This view is the current view of the favorite person screen and should remain as is.
