### Bug Report

on some screens like watchlists, custom lists and favorites, you can long press on the media card to bring up the add to list modal but it never works on the first long press, i have to do it a second time for the modal to appear. consider the following:

1. i visit any of the screens mentioned above
2. i long press a media card (i get haptic feedback) and nothing happens
3. i long press again and see the add to list modal
4. i navigate to a different screen and come back
5. i have to long press twice again for the modal to work

do you understand or have any questions?
