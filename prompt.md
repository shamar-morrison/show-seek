### Feature Request

A list of the 10 latest trailers fetched from TMDB upcoming movies/tv shows endpoint. Filtered by official trailers and YouTube.

### Implementation Details

- Add a new section on the Home Screen called “Latest Trailers” which will show 5 movie and 5 tv show trailers fetched from the aforementioned endpoints.
- Currently we only allow 6 lists to be pinned to the Home Screen and by default we have 6 already, you can remove “top rated” from the DEFAULT_HOME_LISTS and add the trailers list instead and put it at the top, the user can always re-add top rated list section later if needed
- The layout of the trailers list should follow how videos are displayed in the videos component on the tv and movie detail screens

if you have any questions you can ask.
