### Bug Description

---

the reminders are not working in production. as you can see from the screenshot i had a reminder set for today (dec. 9, 2025) at 9AM and its now 10:18AM (as you can see from the screenshot) and i didnt get a notification on my phone. I generated and installed a production .apk with “**npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile preview”** to test it out.
