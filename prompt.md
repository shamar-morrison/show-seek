### Bug Report

When a new user logs in (who is not premium) they have “Latest Trailers” checked in the Home Screen customization sheet and “top rated” is unchecked which is not suppose to be the case. It’s suppose to be the other way around, latest trailers is suppose to be unchecked and top rated is suppose to be checked. Do you understand?
