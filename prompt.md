I want to revamp the login screen and remove the signup screen, here are the changes:

- remove the signup screen and signup flow, if a user logs in with Google and they don't have an account one is automatically created (Confirm if this is true though), so the sign up screen is not needed.

- remove the email/password input fields and sign in button (Keep the login code though because we may bring it back but mark is as deprecated, or if its better to remove it just do that, you decide)

- put the continue as guest button below the continue with google button
