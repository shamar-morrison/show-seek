currently if a user is not a premium member and they click the `trakt integration` button they get redirected to the premium upgrade screen, i want to change the flow:

1. remove the premium lock badge from the `trakt integration` button so the button looks normal
2. add the premium badge to the `connect with trakt` button on the integration screen instead, that way the user can visit this screen and see how integration works and get more info

do you understand and have any questions?
