Please make the following changes:

- The date buttons at the top (today, tomorrow, etc.). Are wrapping so a word such as /"tomorrow" raps onto two lines. I think it's best to just make each button fit-content and for buttons with dates (e.g., Sat, Jan. 24) put it in one line.

- when the "today" button is selected the text remains red so it cant be seen because the background is also red, make the text white when the button is active.

- the "bell" icon which indicates a reminder was set for the media that is on the card needs to be wrapped in a circular background like the other icons (movie/tv show icon)
