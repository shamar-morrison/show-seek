1. I'm leaving this up to users common sense, if they set a reminder for a show that drops entire seasons at once (so each episode will actually have the same release date), just reminder them for one episode (check out if the code handles this or not already)
2. they have to set reminders for new seasons, if a season ends they stop receiving reminders
3. still arrive at 9AM EST
4. currently reminders can only be set for ongoing series but if a series becomes cancelled then no more reminders should be sent out after the final episode (check if the code already handles this)
5. check the code and confirm
6. this is the bug I was trying to fix, if the user is trying to schedule a reminder for episodes/seasons and the next episode/season air date is the same date as today then the user should be notified of such and told the reminders will begin for the subsequent episode/season
7. check the code but i believe so
