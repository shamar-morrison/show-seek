the following text on these screens are not being translated:

- the home screen: the row titles (upcoming movies, latest trailers, trending movies, etc)
- the search screen: the screen title, the tabs, the input placeholder, the empty state
- discover screen: the screen title, the tabs, the filter texts
- library screen: the screen title, the button texts (watch lists, custom lists, stats & history, etc)
- all of the text of the profile screen (you said before the profile screen is too large, you can refactor it into smaller components first before updating if that makes it more manageable)
