### Bug Description

---

after i create a list using the “create custom list” button in the add to list modal, scrolling the list items does not work. Consider the following:

1. I open the create list modal from the add to list modal
2. Enter a list name and hit create
3. List gets created successfully, but I cannot scroll the list items in order to see the list
4. Close the add to list modal and reopen it to enable scrolling again

This happens intermittently, I cannot reproduce the bug all the time but it happens enough that it’s a genuine issue.
