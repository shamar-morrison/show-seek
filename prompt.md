please make the following fixes:

- the mood-picker screen is not scrollable
- the mood-picker and mood-results screens do not have the same margins as the rest of the screens on the app, see how the rest of the screens apply padding/margin and do it here as well for consistency, specifically the top of the screens are too close to the status bar.
- remove the lucide-icon icons (the ones in the round containers) from the picker cards and just the the emojis
- the two column grid for the movies and shows on the results screen is not aligned in the center properly, it is offset to the left slightly so there is more margin on the right, please align properly
- on the results screen, remove the title (the title that ends in "picks") and just use the title with the emoji
