### Bug Description

---

the reminder modal does not take into account tv show series premiere. consider the following:

1. the tv detail screen does not show the reminder button for a tv show that has series premiere date (season 1 episode 1 date)
2. there is no way to set a reminder for the series premiere and/or subsequent episodes.

I am using the tdmb api and you can see an example of a tv show that is premiering in jan. 2026 here: https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/224372-a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-the-hedge-knight. given this, the reminder option should be available dont you think?. you can ask any questions you have as well
