i made some changes to the backend api because it wasnt formatting the data imported from trakt correctly and now it is but i realise there is a bug. in the screenshot of the grid view you can see there are items that have no info (no poster, no title/name, no release date, etc) but then if i change it to list view you can now see the name/title and the release year (the other data is still missing but thats fine) so why does the data show in list view and not grid view. this happens in favorites, already watched, should watch and watching and it happens randomly among media items but they are all being saved the same way when being imported from trakt (before being enriched)
