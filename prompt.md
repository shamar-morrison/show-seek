### Changes required

- i want to make changes to the the `tracked integration` button on the profile screen. i want to replace the icon with the trakt logo.
- on the integration screen i want to replace the icon in the middle with the trakt icon and the showseek icon, the trakt icon should be on the left with an arrow in the middle pointing to the showseek icon on the right (indicating data flows from trakt to showseek), the showseek icon should also be put in a circle so it appear rounded, do not edit the trakt icon. both icons should be of the same size visually
- replace the `<- Back` button text in the header with the regular arrow

do you have any questions
