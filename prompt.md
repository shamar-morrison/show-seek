the heart icon that appears in the top right hand corner of a person card when a person is in the users favorite people SHOULD NOT appear on the cards (grid and list view) on the favorite people detail screen, because it does not make sense to show the icon on those cards because the user would already know they are apart of their favorites, do you understand?
