### Feature Request

---

I want to add a feature that will allow users to rename custom lists from the manage lists screen and the custom lists detail screen

### How it should work

---

- In the manage lists screen, you can put an edit icon next to the trash icon that when clicked will trigger a modal that will allow the user to rename the list.
- In the custom list detail screen you can put an edit icon in the header top right that when clicked will trigger the same modal so the user can rename the list.

If you have any questions you can ask.
