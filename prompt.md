Whenever the app initially loads, I see a screen with the header "index" at the top. Then the app loads the home screen. I assume this happens because Index is the initial route that the app goes to before it goes to the home screen. But it is quite jarring to see that screen then immediately change to the home screen. Do you understand what I mean?
