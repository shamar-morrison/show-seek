# Product Guidelines

## Communication Tone
- **Minimalist & Subtle:** The application will use very few words, relying primarily on clear interface elements, icons, and intuitive design patterns to communicate. Text should be used only when absolutely necessary, maintaining a calm and uncluttered user experience.

## Interaction & Feedback
- **Subtle & Meaningful:** Haptic feedback and animations should be used sparingly and only for significant actions (e.g., successful list additions, completing a season). This ensures that feedback remains meaningful without overwhelming the user, reinforcing the minimalist design philosophy.

## Visual Identity & Theming
- **Strict Dark Mode:** To maintain a "cinema-first" aesthetic and immersive experience, the application will exclusively support Dark Mode. This decision aligns with the consumption of media content and reduces eye strain in low-light environments.

## Information Density
- **Balanced Layout:** The interface will strike a balance between visual impact and utility. High-value content (e.g., "Trending Now" or detail headers) will utilize spacious layouts with large imagery, while secondary information (e.g., "Season Episodes" or "Search Results") will employ more compact lists to facilitate efficient browsing.

## Accessibility Strategy
- **Minimal Initial Scope:** The initial development phase will rely on the standard accessibility features provided by the underlying framework components. While basic accessibility will be present via standard defaults, custom overrides for advanced accessibility needs will not be a primary focus in the early iterations.
